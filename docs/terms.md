</div>

**Introduction**
The Xtra Computing Server provides computational resources (GPU, CPU, memory, and storage) primarily to support research and academic activities. Users must follow the guidelines outlined in this document to ensure fair resource allocation and maintain a productive computing environment.

!!! info "Important"
    Resources are intended for the use of Xtra Computing Group only.

!!! warning
    Any misuse may result in the termination of your computing tasks.

## Account

### Creation

Users must apply via the provided registration form: https://forms.gle/Wf8qbNeuSPS2ia8u6

Account validity is determined by the expiration date provided by the user during registration, subject to confirmation by the administrator.

After approval, follow the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md) for
account onboarding, server addresses, and basic resource-use rules.

### Account Management

| Event              | Action                 | Notes                                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Account Expiration | Account Frozen         | You cannot log in. Contact admin within 6 months to unfreeze. |
| 6 months post-expiration | Account Removal | Data preserved temporarily in cold-storage[^1]; integrity not guaranteed. |
| 12 months post-expiration | Data Deletion | Files permanently deleted; recovery impossible.         |

[^1]: Cold storage refers to a type of data storage designed for infrequently accessed data. Since moving data in and out of cold storage takes a long time, it is mainly used for archiving or backup purposes rather than for data that needs to be accessed frequently.

All notifications and alerts are communicated exclusively via your registered email address.

!!! danger "Caution"
    If your account remains expired, your data may be removed after 6 months and permanently deleted after 12 months.

**Unfreezing Your Account**
To request reactivation after account freezing, contact the administrator. Reactivation requests are typically processed within 1-2 business days.

### Leaving the Research Group

Access to Xtra Computing servers ends immediately when a user leaves the Xtra Computing Research Group or NUS.

!!! danger "Caution"
    **Back up your data before you leave.** Your access is terminated on your departure date. You will not receive any advance reminder that your account is about to expire, and no grace period is provided for retrieving data afterwards.

Upon departure:

- The user's account is frozen on the departure date. Login access ends at that point.
- No advance notice, reminder, or expiry warning is sent before access is terminated. It is entirely the user's responsibility to migrate their data and computing environments before their departure date.
- Server resources must not be used for personal work, external projects, employment, or research unrelated to the Xtra Computing Research Group.

Once the account is frozen, any remaining data is handled under the standard data-retention rules described in [Account Management](#account-management): moved to cold storage after 6 months and permanently deleted after 12 months. Data integrity in cold storage is not guaranteed, and retrieval requests may be declined.

Exceptions are granted only on a case-by-case basis and may be revoked at any time due to security, operational, or SoC IT requirements.

## Acceptable Use and Security

Users must not:

- Share accounts, passwords, SSH keys, access tokens, or any other credentials.
- Mine cryptocurrency or use server resources for related activities.
- Conduct unauthorized attacks, vulnerability scans, network scans, malware activity, or attempts to disrupt systems or other users.
- Bypass, evade, disable, or interfere with resource limits, monitoring, access controls, or policy-enforcement mechanisms.
- Store, distribute, or process unlawful content, or violate software licenses, copyrights, or other intellectual-property rights.
- Process sensitive, regulated, confidential, or research-participant data without prior approval from the administrator and any other approvals required by applicable institutional policies.

This list is not exhaustive. Upon discovery of any such activity, the account will be permanently banned. These violations are not subject to the progressive offense schedule described below.

---

## Disk

Each user has a `home` disk quota. Data integrity is not guaranteed, and backups are the user's responsibility.

For quotas, backups, privacy, and disk usage accounting, see: [Disk Storage](disk.md).

---

## GPU

### Default Quota

We aim to ensure that all users have equal and convenient access to GPU resources. Our system is designed to be as unrestricted as possible while maintaining fairness among users.

| User Category          | GPUs Allowed Without Application |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| all_user           | 2 GPUs freely                    |


Users can utilize GPUs freely within their quota and may also exceed their quota when additional GPUs are available and not in use by others.

The GPU quota defines the maximum standard allocation that may be used without an application. It is not a guarantee of GPU availability, uninterrupted access, job completion, or performance.

If you have compute-intensive tasks, please consider using the [HACC Cluster](https://hacc.xtra.science) or the [SoC Cluster](https://dochub.comp.nus.edu.sg/cf/guides/compute-cluster/access), which are better suited for high-performance computing needs. To use the HACC Cluster, submit the [HACC cluster account application](https://forms.gle/fvfPgJypd1sSWzHm8). Note that the SoC Cluster documentation is only accessible from within the SoC intranet.

### Extra GPU Usage

**You can use more than 2 GPUs without application.** However, extra GPU usage beyond your quota is opportunistic and subject to preemption:

- Jobs using GPUs within the standard quota are not guaranteed to remain available or uninterrupted.
- GPUs beyond your quota are **best-effort**. When another user needs GPUs to fill their own quota, your extra jobs may be terminated to free up resources.
- Any GPU job may also be interrupted or terminated because of maintenance, failures, security incidents, policy enforcement, or other operational needs.
- The administrator may attempt to notify affected users before termination, but advance notice is not guaranteed.
- Users running extra GPU jobs should implement checkpointing to minimize progress loss from preemption.

!!! info "Important"
    Jobs exceeding your GPU quota may be terminated at any time to ensure fair access for all users. Always checkpoint your work.

### Responsible Use

To ensure fair and efficient utilization of our shared GPU infrastructure, we are introducing the following resource management policy effective immediately:

#### Automatic Termination Policy

Any process that:
1. Occupies large GPU memory, and
2. Maintains less than 1% GPU utilization continuously for 10 minutes

may be automatically terminated by the system.

!!! warning
    Low-utilization, high-memory GPU jobs are subject to automatic termination.

#### User Responsibility

Users are fully responsible for monitoring their jobs. Any loss of progress, data, or runtime caused by automatic termination under this policy is the responsibility of the job owner.

Please ensure that your scripts:
1. Do not hold GPU memory while idle
2. Properly release resources when inactive
3. Avoid prolonged zero-utilization states

!!! danger "Caution"
    Progress or data loss caused by policy-triggered termination is the user’s responsibility.

#### Temporary Exceptions

Temporary exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis depending on the application. If your workload legitimately requires GPU memory residency with low or zero utilization, please contact the administrator in advance with justification.

Thank you for your cooperation.

### Reserve GPUs  

To reserve GPUs, please fill out the reservation form: [Reservation Form](https://forms.gle/6W1CxQAojMANpx1FA).

## CPU & Memory

Each user is subject to a **500 GiB RAM limit** per node, normally enforced via the systemd `user-.slice` cgroup. Processes that exceed this limit may be OOM-killed within the user's slice. Enforcement behavior and process isolation are not guaranteed. Higher limits may be granted on request with justification.

CPU usage is not capped by default. On a single machine, if a user's processes continuously consume CPU capacity equivalent to more than 50% of that machine's logical CPU cores for more than 8 consecutive hours, a per-machine CPU quota will be imposed without advance notice. The quota limits the user's aggregate CPU usage on that machine to one quarter (1/4) of its logical CPU cores. Once imposed, the quota remains in effect permanently. Beyond the RAM cap, memory usage is not otherwise limited. However, excessive memory usage that negatively impacts others may result in penalties.

Excessive usage is determined based on its impact on system stability

- Out-of-memory (OOM) errors that prevent other users from accessing the server (e.g., making it impossible to SSH in).
- Any behavior that requires administrator intervention to restore normal operations.

| Offense Times | Action                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1st           | Notification                          |
| 2nd           | Warning                               |
| 3rd           | Account frozen for 2 days             |
| 4th           | Account frozen for 2 weeks            |
| 5th           | Permanent ban from all infrastructures|

The offense counter starts from the date of the first violation and is monitored over a rolling 3-month window. Offenses outside this window are not counted. *(Provisional rule, subject to revision.)*

Administrators may determine that a violation occurred and impose a penalty based on their operational judgment; no formal evidence or evidentiary procedure is required. Affected users may appeal by contacting the administrator. The administrator has sole and final authority to interpret these terms and determine the outcome of violations, exceptions, enforcement actions, and appeals.

### Docker-induced Violations

Misuse via Docker containers — including (but not limited to) causing OOM errors or improperly occupying GPUs — follows its own escalation focused on Docker privileges:

| Offense Times | Action                                                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st           | Notification                                                    |
| 2nd           | Warning                                                         |
| 3rd           | Permanent revocation of Docker privileges; account flagged     |

The same rolling 3-month window applies. *(Provisional rule, subject to revision.)*

---

## Containers

!!! info "Important"
    **Docker access for regular users is being removed by default at the end of
    September 2026 (from 2026-09-30).** Migrate Docker-based workloads to
    Apptainer before then. Apptainer supports most Docker/OCI images and is
    suitable for GPU and HPC workloads.

Apptainer runs containers as your own user, without a daemon or a
root-equivalent group, and keeps workloads visible to per-user resource
accounting. It is already installed on the shared compute nodes.

Docker access may still be granted for exceptional cases where it is technically
necessary. If you rely on Docker-specific features that cannot easily be
migrated, contact the administrators **in advance**, before the cutover date.

For migration instructions, command equivalents, and the exception request
procedure, see: [Containers: Docker Deprecation and Apptainer](apptainer.md).

The escalation schedule in [Docker-induced Violations](#docker-induced-violations)
applies to Apptainer misuse as well, with container privileges revoked in place
of Docker privileges.

## Network

Users may run services on designated open ports. Port availability is governed by NUS School of Computing firewall policies and may change without notice.

For full details, see: [Network Policy](network.md).

---

### General Disclaimer

All machines, services, and resources are provided entirely **as-is** and **as-available**, without any promise or guarantee of availability, uptime, access, capacity, allocation, uninterrupted execution, job completion, data durability, performance, compatibility, or support. Nothing in these terms or related documents creates a service-level commitment. Xtra Computing Server administrators and affiliates are not responsible for data loss, damages, or inconveniences arising from hardware failures, software issues, operational actions, policy enforcement, or user actions. Users assume full responsibility for data backups and use the resources at their own risk.

!!! danger "Caution"
    Service is provided as-is without warranty. Keep independent backups and recovery plans.
